                            States International University. Apart from being a Sauti Sol member, Bien has also written for artists such as Wendy Kimani, and Amos & Josh. The musician’s tall height, toned abs and astounding vocals have for the longest
                            time made girls go crazy for him. So, many were disappointed when the gifted musician proposed to his girlfriend Chiki Kuruka, who is a dance fitness enthusiast and model, in 2019. They tied the knot on 6 March 2020 in a private
                            wedding ceremony.
